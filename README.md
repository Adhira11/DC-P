This project performs comprehensive preprocessing on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The raw data contains missing values, categorical features, and inconsistent scales that need correction. First, we handle missing data by dropping the incomplete 'Cabin' column and intelligently filling missing 'Age' values with the median (to avoid outlier distortion) and 'Embarked' values with the most frequent category. Next, we convert categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical values using label encoding and one-hot encoding respectively, making them digestible for ML algorithms. We then standardize all numerical features (Age, Fare, etc.) to a common scale using sklearn's StandardScaler, ensuring no single feature dominates due to its original magnitude. Finally, we detect and remove outliers in the 'Fare' feature using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, visualized through boxplots, to prevent skewed model training. The cleaned dataset is saved as titanic_clean.csv, now ready for exploratory analysis or predictive modeling.
